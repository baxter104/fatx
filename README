Compile with:
-D DEBUG	to produce debug informations output
-D DBGCOLOR=x	to produce debug messages with x=2 ansi colors x=1 thread codes prefix x=0 nothing x=-1 no thread number
-D DBG_INIT	to produce debug on initialisation sequence
-D DBG_READ	to print bytes read at device level
-D DBG_WRITE	to print bytes written at device level
-D DBG_SEM	to print accesses to semaphores
-D DBGSEM=\"x\"	to print only semaphore named x
-D DBG_BUFFER	to print buffer operations
-D DBGBUFDMP=x	to print x bytes of buffer at each change
-D DBG_CACHE	to print cache operations
-D DBG_CACHDMP	to dump cache at each change
-D DBG_AREAS	to print fat areas
-D DBG_GUESS	to print guesses
-D DBGCR=x	to limit to x bytes per line
-D DBGLIMIT=x	to limit to x bytes the printing of read/write
-D DBG_FAT	to print the FAT
-D DBG_GAPS	to print gaps
-D NO_WRITE	to fake writing but no modification is done
-D NO_FUSE	to disable fuse support
-D NO_LOCK	to disable semaphores
-D NO_CACHE	to disable FAT cache
-D NO_FUSE_CALL	to disable calls to fuse library
-D NO_SPLICE	to disable splice calls by fuse
-D NO_OPTION	to disable option parsing

Make symlink to executable with names:
 "fusefatx"	for fuse filesystem support
 "mkfs.fatx"	for filesystem creation
 "fsck.fatx"	for filesystem check and repair
 "unrm.fatx"	for recovery of deleted files
 "label.fatx"	for display or change volume name

Use -h option for each symlink call to find syntax and options list
